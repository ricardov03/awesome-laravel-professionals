# awesome-laravel-professionals
If you are here, you love Laravel. I understand Laravel is just amazing; it's a tool that allows you to create something from nothing. After years of working as a developer, I found myself in the position to understand that Laravel is not just a Framework; it is an ecosystem.

Usually, we fall into Laravel through the framework by looking front a list of curated packages for the framework. I want to change the perspective and present the professionals who bring those packages alive. I'm taking this approach to remember that those exceptional professionals are still humans like us but with a resilient spirit and a grand vision.
GitHub Accounts or Website linked to the Name. These are just my top 3 package selections.

## The Framework
- [**Taylor Otwell**](https://github.com/taylorotwell) 🇺🇸 - The Creator. He starts the revolution. Thanks, Space Pilgrim.
  - I discovered some cool interviews and podcasts with Taylor about Laravel's history and some interesting insides; I think it could be nice to save and share those:
