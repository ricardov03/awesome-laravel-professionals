# awesome-laravel-professionals [WIP]
Usually, we always fall into Laravel through the framework looking front a list of curated packages for the framework. I would like to change the perspective and present the Professionals that bring those packages alive. I'm taking this approach to remember to all of us that those amazing professionals are still humans like us, but with a resilient spirit and an amazing vision.
GitHub Accounts linked to the Name. Just my top 3 package selections.

## The Framework
- [**Taylor Otwell**](https://github.com/taylorotwell) 🇺🇸 - The Creator. He starts the revolution. Thanks, Space Pilgrim.
  - I discovered some cool interviews and podcasts with Taylor about Laravel history and some interesting insides, I think could be nice to save and share those:
    - Transistor Podcasting - [Taylor Otwell: "PHP (and a cheap laptop) changed my life"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkdP1N2Bvzs&t=65s)
  - **Projects:**
    - Why not? [The Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com/) itself.
    - [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/) - Server Management solution provided by Laravel.
